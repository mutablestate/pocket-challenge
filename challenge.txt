Pocket PlayLab Developer Challenge
The objective of this challenge is to parse a log file and do some analysis on it. It should be an easy task for anyone with previous experience programming. You can write the script/program in any language of your choice.

Requirements & output

The script/program should output a small analysis of the sample log containing at least the following:

Number of requests in sample
Total time the sample covered (last timestamp - first timestamp)
The amount of requests served pr. minute
Total amount of data sent in megabytes
The average amount of data sent pr. request
The largest amount of data sent in a single request
The output should just be simple text lines.

Log format

The logformat is defined as:

{timestamp} {source}[{process}]: at={log_level} method={http_method} path={http_path} host={http_host} fwd={client_ip} dyno={responding_dyno} connect={connection_time}ms service={processing_time}ms status={http_status} bytes={bytes_sent}
Example:

2014-01-09T06:16:53.916977+00:00 heroku[router]: at=info method=GET path=/api/users/1538823671/count_pending_messages host=services.pocketplaylab.com fwd="208.54.86.162" dyno=web.11 connect=7ms service=9ms status=200 bytes=33
A sample log can be downloaded at https://www.dropbox.com/s/jjd2blth0mcce2x/sample.log
